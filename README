# Zahir

A partial implementation of Lapped Textures with Real-Time Hatching for animated surfaces.

Some notes:

 * The code is three years old :( It's from my Master's Thesis at University of Chile.
 * There are many features from Lapped Textures not implemented and some bugs.
 * There is a Vector Field Smoother class needed for Real-Time Hatching, but at the time of uploading this it doesn't work correctly. It's optional anyway.
 * The Curvature Estimator is based on Szymon Rusinkiewicz code from the trimesh2 library: http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/trimesh2/
 * The License is GPL3
